## My Personal Site

My personal website built using modern javascript with Node.js, React, Express, React-Router, Hot Module Reloading, Webpack and many other technologies.

## Dependencies

Tested with:

* node >= v8, v9, v10, v11, v12
* Recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) for managing node versions

## Set up

1. To download the repository and install dependencies, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    git clone git://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site.git
    cd personal-site
    npm install
    ```

2. Next, you should create a `.env` file. To do this, run:

    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

    and set values as appropriate.

3. Run the following command to build the react application and serve it with hot module reloading:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Navigate to `<ip>:<port>` default: [http://localhost:7999](http://localhost:7999) to view my website.

    This completes set up instructions.
